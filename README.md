Hello! I'm [**Ashwin** Gopalsamy](https://github.com/ashwingopalsamy/). 
I build **internet-scale software systems.**

I focus on **backend development** and **distributed systems**, with an eye for crafting products that make a difference.


I also write at [Substack](https://ashwingopalsamy.substack.com), build open-source at [@ash3in](github.com/ash3in) and occasionally design at [figma](https://www.figma.com/@ashwin2125). 

Being bilingually proficient in **English & German**, I bring effective collaboration, diverse & meaningful contributions across cross-functional teams & geographies.
